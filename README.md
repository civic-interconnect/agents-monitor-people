This agent queries basic people metadata from OpenStates using their GraphQL API.
It creates daily snapshot reports of people counts by jurisdiction to help track overall system volume and schema stability.

## Current Status

- Pulls OpenStates peoples via GraphQL (high-level people IDs only)
- Generates daily jurisdiction-level summary reports
- Introspection/schema monitoring not yet enabled
- Deeper people content monitoring (texts, sponsors, versions, etc.) not yet implemented
